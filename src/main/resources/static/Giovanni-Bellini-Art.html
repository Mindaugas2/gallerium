                    <p>The Feast of the Gods is an oil painting by the Italian Renaissance master Giovanni Bellini, with substantial additions in stages to the left and center landscape by Dosso Dossi and Titian. It is one of the few mythological pictures by the Venetian artist. Completed in 1514, it was his last major work. It is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., which calls it "one of the greatest Renaissance paintings in the United States".</p>

                    <p>The painting is the first major depiction of the subject of the "Feast of the Gods" in Renaissance art, which was to remain in currency until the end of Northern Mannerism over a century later. It has several similarities to another, much less sophisticated, treatment painted by the Florentine artist Bartolomeo di Giovanni in the 1490s, now in the Louvre.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Subject | Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>The work is atypical of Renaissance mythological painting in the down to earth treatment of the main deities, which may be accounted for by the figures beginning as ordinary citizens of Thebes, and by Bellini's inexperience in the emerging conventions of mythological art. The work was a considerable departure from his usual subject-matter of religious scenes and portraits for Bellini, who was over 80 when he began it.</p>
                    
                    <p>The painting shows the incident of the attempted rape of Lotis. She was a nymph, mentioned by Ovid, the daughter of Neptune or Nereus. During a festival in honor of Liber that she attended, Priapus tried to rape her while she was asleep, but she was awakened by a sudden cry of Silenus's ass and ran off, leaving Priapus in embarrassment as everyone else woke up too and became aware of his intentions. The story is shown at the edges of the composition, in a somewhat undramatic fashion presumably showing a moment shortly before the key incident, with Silenus and his ass at left and Priapus and Lotis at right (and everyone but Lotis still wide awake). The subject had been depicted in the first illustrated edition of Ovid in Italian, published in Venice in 1497.</p>

                    <p>The figures shown are usually taken to be (left to right): a satyr, Silenus with his ass, his ward Bacchus as a boy, Silvanus (or Faunus), Mercury with his caduceus and helmet, a satyr, Jupiter, a nymph serving, Cybele, Pan, Neptune, two standing nymphs, Ceres, Apollo, Priapus, Lotis. Some of the figures may be portraits of people at the Ferrara court, including Alfonso and his wife Lucrezia Borgia.</p>

                    <p>Another suggestion is that the couple in the center, the male with his hand between the female's thighs, are a bridal pair, as shown by their intimacy and the quince she is holding, a fruit recommended for brides. If he is still Neptune, this would make her Amphitrite.</p>

                    <p>For Giovanni Bellini and his busy workshop, devotional images of the Virgin and Child were mainstays. Between about 1460 and 1500 they painted countless half-length Madonnas, revolutionizing the image in the process. Rather than faithfully copy the look of the old Madonnas, Bellini attempted a “spiritual likeness.”</p>
                    
                    <p>10 Bellini’s works share with icons a sense of monumentality, isolation, and austerity. Above all, it is Bellini’s use of light that conveys the mood, luminosity evokes a numinous presence. His figures are radiant, his landscapes lit by a dawn glow, light fills the entire space of his compositions. Bellini was among the first to master the new techniques of oil painting, which made this brilliant color possible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 article-paragraph-margin">
                    <h3 class="display-2">The idea</h3>
                    <p>The Virgin’s oval face, arched brows, and long, elegant features are similar to those of a Byzantine Madonna. So is the rounded contour of the mantle drawn low over her brow. The child’s body and energetic posture, however, do not at all recall the way icon painters presented the infant Jesus—as a miniature adult in a regal, frontal pose. Here he steps onto the parapet as his mother wraps him protectively in her cloak. She looks out pensively to the viewer communicating the sad knowledge of her child’s future sacrifice, which he too appears to consider, with a sidelong gaze. Bellini achieves the spiritual power of an icon with the radiance of the figures, who seem almost to glow with an internal light.</p>

                    <p>Beginning around 1500, Bellini painted fewer images of the Virgin and Child alone and instead added saints on either side. Essentially, these compositions were reduced versions of the sacra conversazione, a type especially popular for altarpieces. In the 1520s the sacra conversazione was the most common sort of painting in Venice. It's wider horizontal format invited experimentation with scenes that depicted the Virgin and Child set within a landscape, sometimes at three-quarter or even full length.</p>

                    <p>Giovanni Bellini would paint St Jerome several times, but this version, now in Birmingham, is thought to be, not only his first depiction of the saint, but his earliest surviving work.

                    <p>St. Jerome in the Wilderness is an on wood painting by Giovanni Bellini, now in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham, England. Universally recognised as Bellini's earliest surviving work, it depicts Saint Jerome shown seated on a rock in front of his cave in the Syrian Desert with a book in his left hand, referring to his life as a hermit and as the producer of the Vulgate Bible, and his faithful lion in front of him.</p>

                    <p>Saint Jerome was a scholar who translated the Bible into Latin. He also retired to the wilderness and lived the  secluded of a hermit.  According to legend, he removed a thorn from the paw of a lion who then became his companion.  Here, Jerome exchanges the scholar’s study for a cave.  Beyond is a sunlit landscape full of closely-observed natural details representing the comfortable life he has forsaken and the future he will gain.</p>
                        
                    <p>Giovanni Bellini played a crucial role in the development of Venetian painting, introducing a glowing use of colour and a new feeling for landscape.</p>

                    <p>Often resurrection scenes seem a bit awkward, but here it's the opposite. Nothing is forced or contrived. Figure and landscape blend like a seamless garment. This is Bellini at his best.</p>
                        
                    <p>A contemporary poet lamented that had a figure of Christ been painted by Bellini, rather than by a lesser artist, it would’ve been “much more human and more divine”. Bellini sets before us a figure of Risen Christ in which humanity, divinity and the whole creation co-exist beautifully.</p>

                    <p>The portrait depicts Jesus Christ, raising his right hand while gripping a red staff with the other. Christ's wounds are slightly visible on his hand as well as his chest. The shadows indicate the reality of his Resurrection.</p> 
                        
                    <p>Meanwhile, the landscape in the background contains many motifs signifying the Resurrection. The withered tree and solitary bird on the left of the panel represent the Old Covenant, out of which the New Covenant will grow. The pair of rabbits in the lower left corner are symbols of regeneration, and the three robed figures in the lower right corner are the Three Marys. The bell tower in the distance conveys the message that salvation can be found through Christ and the Church. Although the species is not very clear, the bird has been said to be a magpie, a species also featured in Pieter Bruegel the Elder's The Magpie on the Gallows (1568).</p>

                    <p>The work is set in a large niche, depicting a sacred conversation within an established scheme: the Madonna and Child enthroned, a musician angel on a step and four saints placed symmetrically at the sides. They are St. Peter the Apostle, St. Catherine of Alexandria, St. Lucy and St. Jerome.</p>
                        
                    <p>While the general ensemble is not different from previous works, such as the San Giobbe Altarpiece (which shares the apse with mosaics, for example), Bellini introduced some novelties, such as the side openings with landscape, inspired by Alvise Vivarini Battutii Altarpiece, once in Belluno (now lost). The colors and light show the new adherence of Bellini to Giorgione's color and mood style. The egg above Mary's head is a symbol of the creation, perhaps a citation of Piero della Francesca's Brera Altarpiece. The lucerne below recalls Andrea Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece.</p>

                    <p>In this painting Bellini used a combination of oil and tempera paints, perhaps having been under the influence of Antonello da Messina.The painting shows the influence of Andrea Mantegna, who was the painter's brother-in-law. However, the original painting would not be much larger than the present by estimation. Though it has been cut down, it has otherwise been well-cared for since its creation.</p>

                    <p>The painting contains a strong effect of mystical light through the use of golden rays coming from the uppermost left corner of the painting, showering over Saint Francis. His brighter body contrasts with the darker environment of the painting. In the foreground, the focus is on a stony, dangerous, dark, and mossy cave with a shady entrance covered by twisted grapevines. Inside the cave, several possessions of the saint are represented, including a Holy Book, desk, hermit’s skull, a thorny crown, and a crucifix made of stems. Although the scene is rocky, it does not look infertile. The landscape depicts a transformation into spring through the inclusion of growing grass.</p>

                    <p>The painting depicts St. Francis having come out of his cave in a brown traditional robe, standing barefooted, looking upwards at paradise with widely opened arms and heaving chest. The rocks around him in the painting are converting into a stream, implying that his life has just transformed. In the painting, a mystical light is showered over St. Francis; he seems to be absorbing this light and spreading it throughout the entire painting.</p>
