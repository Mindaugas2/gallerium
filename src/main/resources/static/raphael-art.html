                    <p>The School of Athens (Italian: Scuola di Atene) is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist
                        Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the
                        rooms now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.</p>
                    <p>The Stanza della Segnatura was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and The School of Athens,
                        representing philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after La Disputa
                        (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the Parnassus (Literature). The painting is notable for
                        its accurate perspective projection, which Raphael learned from Leonardo da Vinci (who is the
                        central figure of this painting, representing Plato). The rebirth of Ancient Greek Philosophy
                        and culture in Europe (along with Raphael's work) were inspired by Leonardo's individual
                        pursuits in theatre, engineering, optics, geometry, physiology, anatomy, history, architecture
                        and art. This work has long been seen as "Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of
                        the classical spirit of the Renaissance". </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description</h3>
                    <p>The School of Athens is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on
                        either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each
                        theme is identified above by a separate tondo containing a majestic female figure seated in the
                        clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: "Seek Knowledge of Causes", "Divine Inspiration",
                        "Knowledge of Things Divine" (Disputa), "To Each What Is Due". Accordingly, the figures on the
                        walls below exemplify philosophy, poetry (including music), theology, and justice.</p>
                    <p>The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the painting is actually philosophy, or at
                        least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, "Causarum Cognitio", tells us what
                        kind, as it appears to echo Aristotle's emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the
                        causes, in Metaphysics Book I and Physics Book II. Indeed, Plato and Aristotle appear to be the
                        central figures in the scene. However, many of the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of
                        first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The
                        architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and
                        Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' monad.</p>

                    <p>The Madonna of the Pinks (c. 1506 – 1507, Italian: La Madonna dei garofani) is an early
                        devotional painting usually attributed to Italian Renaissance master Raphael. It is painted in
                        oils on fruitwood and now hangs in the National Gallery, London.</p>
                    <p>The painting depicts a youthful Virgin Mary playing with the Christ child and handing him
                        carnations. (The Italian title, La Madonna dei garofani actually means The Madonna of the
                        Carnation.) These flowers, whose botanical name is dianthus (Greek for ‘flower of God’), are a
                        premonition of Christ's Passion – according to Christian legend, the flower first appeared when
                        the Virgin wept at the Crucifixion. The event takes place in a dimly-lit domestic setting
                        influenced by Netherlandish art. The composition is based closely on the Benois Madonna by
                        Leonardo da Vinci, although the colour scheme of blues and greens that link the Virgin with the
                        landscape is Raphael's own. Through the arched window is a landscape with a ruined building,
                        symbolising the collapse of the pagan world at the birth of Christ.</p>
                    <p>The subject matter and size of the painting, little larger than a Book of Hours, suggest that it
                        may have been intended as a portable aid to prayer. The identity of its original patron is
                        unknown, although an inventory from the 1850s suggests that it was commissioned for Maddalena
                        degli Oddi, a member of a prominent Perugian family, after she had taken holy orders.
                        In the 19th century it was property of the painter Vincenzo Camuccini.

                        Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael in the Raphael Rooms ("Stanze di Raffaello"), in the
                        Palace of the Vatican in Rome, painted at the commission of Pope Julius II. It was probably the
                        second wall of the Stanza della Segnatura to be painted between 1509 and 1511,[1] after La
                        Disputa and before The School of Athens, which occupy other walls of the room. </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description and provenance</h3>
                    <p>The whole room shows the four areas of human knowledge: philosophy, religion, poetry and law,
                        with The Parnassus representing poetry. The fresco shows the mythological Mount Parnassus where
                        Apollo dwells; he is in the centre playing an instrument (a contemporary lira da braccio rather
                        than a classical lyre), surrounded by the nine muses, nine poets from antiquity, and nine
                        contemporary poets. Apollo, along with Calliope, the muse of epic poetry, inspired poets.</p>
                    <p>Raphael used the face of Laocoön from the classical sculpture Laocoön and His Sons, excavated in
                        1506 and also in the Vatican for his Homer (in dark blue robe to the left of centre), expressing
                        blindness rather than pain.[5] Two of the female figures in the fresco have been said to be
                        reminiscent of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, Euterpe and Sappho, who is named on a scroll she
                        holds.[6] Sappho is the only female poet shown, presumably identified so that she is not
                        confused with a muse; she is a late addition who does not appear in the print by Marcantonio
                        Raimondi that records a drawing for the fresco.</p>

                    <p>TIt shows the common subject of Christ Carrying the Cross to his crucifixion, at the moment when
                        he fell and his mother suffers a spasm of agony, the Swoon of the Virgin, or "Lo Spasimo".
                        All the emotion of the painting is densely crammed into the foreground and the background is
                        similar to that of a stage set with distant groups of people and crosses. The man on the left in
                        the foreground is similar to a figure in Raphael's painting The Judgement of Solomon in the
                        Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Palace, except reversed. Simon of Cyrene lifts Christ's cross
                        momentarily and looks sternly at the guards. The four Marys are depicted on the right side of
                        the painting and towering on either side of the composition are the guards. The concept of,
                        and devotion to, the "spasm" of the Virgin was fashionable, if somewhat controversial, in
                        early-16th-century Catholicism, although in this work the Virgin has only fallen to her knees,
                        not collapsed or fainted, as is often shown. </p>

                    <p>The Portrait of a Young Woman (also known as La fornarina) is a painting by the Italian High
                        Renaissance master Raphael, made between 1518 and 1519. It is in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte
                        Antica in Palazzo Barberini, Rome.</p>

                    <p>It is probable that the picture was in the painter's studio at his death in 1520, and that it was
                        modified and then sold by his assistant Giulio Romano.</p>
                    <p>The woman is traditionally identified with the fornarina (baker) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman
                        lover who refused to marry him, though this has been questioned. Alternatively, it can be
                        argued that this is not a portrait of a specific woman, but rather Raphael's interpretation of
                        the belle donne theme and a depiction of a courtesan.[3] Still, another interpretation of who
                        the model is identifies the figure as a witch.</p>
